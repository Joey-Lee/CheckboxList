# CheckboxList (Swift)

CheckboxList is customizable list of checkboxes that allows easy user selection in iOS from a short list of options.

It inherits from UIView and allows the user to set the options listed (let's hope), the font, the text color, whether the user can choose exactly one option or as many as they want, and between round and square boxes next to the options. The corners are slightly rounded as shown by default.
